# Landing page project
This project is required from udacity nanodegree to build a multi-section landing page using html, css andjavascript, with a dynamically updating navigation menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

## PROJECT SPECIFICATION
- Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.Start with empty ul and dynamically build navigation using Append, appendChild, and innerHTML.
- It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
- When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.

### List of features to be added in the future
These are some of the features that I will work on later to develop the landing page 
- Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
- Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load).
- Add a scroll to top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
- Update/change the design/content.
- Put some animation in the background
- put contact form
